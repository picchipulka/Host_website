📋 Initial Product Decision Matrix: Generic Content Hub MVP1. Strategic GoalsMetricTargetRationaleMinimum Viable Product (MVP) ScopeCore static pages (Home, About, Contact, Services/Products listing).Focus on establishing a professional online presence quickly and validating core messaging.Cost Constraint$<\$5$/month (Introductory)Adhere to budget requirements by leveraging promotional pricing and free open-source tools.Operational GoalInformation DeliveryThe site must reliably deliver content and capture user contact information (via a simple form).2. Technology Trade-offs (Hosting & Infrastructure)To achieve the low-cost objective, we prioritize ease-of-use and affordability over raw performance and dedicated control.Decision AreaChosen Approach (MVP)RationaleTrade-Off (The Compromise)Hosting ModelShared Hosting (Tier 1 Budget Provider)Lowest TCO (Total Cost of Ownership). Includes mandatory features like SSL and usually a free domain.Resource Contention: Performance is dependent on the activity of other websites on the server. Response times may suffer under moderate load.Application LayerWordPress CMSProvides robust, user-friendly content management with zero licensing cost (Open Source). Speeds up initial content deployment.Security Overhead: Requires constant attention to updates (core, themes, plugins) to mitigate vulnerability risks.Backend StackLAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)The industry standard for shared hosting; universally supported and highly reliable for standard content sites.Modernity: Less agility and performance compared to newer stacks (e.g., Node.js with dedicated hosting), but far cheaper to maintain.Site DeploymentCPanel/One-Click InstallerRapid deployment of the CMS. Eliminates the need for manual server configuration, meeting the fast TTM goal.No Version Control: Changes are made directly in the production environment (via the CMS dashboard), increasing the risk of errors.3. Website Quality & Performance Metrics (MVP Standard)We define the minimum acceptable quality standards to ensure a professional user experience and effective search engine indexing.A. Technical PerformanceMetricTarget StandardMeasurement ToolPM Action RequiredSearch Engine Optimization (SEO)Pass core technical audits (robots.txt, sitemap).Google Search Console (Free)Install an SEO plugin (e.g., Yoast, Rank Math) and configure basic settings.Core Web VitalsPassing score (green) for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).Google PageSpeed InsightsSelect a fast, well-coded WordPress theme and compress all primary images.Security StatusActive HTTPS certificate.Browser padlock icon checkEnsure the free SSL certificate provided by the host is correctly installed and active.B. User Experience (UX) and Content QualityQuality ElementRequirement (MVP)Success CriteriaInformation ArchitectureClear, logical navigation structure (3-5 main pages).User Testing: Three external testers must find the Contact page in $\le 5$ seconds.Content ClarityAll core pages must be free of grammatical errors and clearly define the product/service.All copy is reviewed and signed off by a designated content editor.BrandingConsistent logo placement, color palette, and font styles across all pages.Use the WordPress customizer to enforce brand styles globally.Lead CaptureFunctional, simple contact form on the 'Contact' page.The form successfully sends a test email notification to the designated product owner inbox.By adhering to this framework, we can confidently launch a reliable, professional, and easily maintainable generic content hub while respecting the stringent budget limitations.Now that we have the strategy documented, shall we proceed with the Domain Selection and Hosting Procurement?
